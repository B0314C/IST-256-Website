The stones with flash are gorgeous, but the ones without flash are beautiful in their own way and often feature striations and little rainbows in sunlight. All stones are polished in a rotary rock tumbler and are shiny without any treatments or oils. If you would like a specific stone, just message me and then put in an order for a stone from the category it is listed under.\n\nMetaphysical properties: calming, activating and aligning all chakras, keeping your mind clear and open, bringing transformation and new opportunities.\n\nAll orders ship in a compostable bubble mailer with a small, purple, mesh, drawstring bag and a thank you note made from recycled paper.","ProdCateg":"Tumbled","UnitOfMeasures":"1 Stone","MinProdPrice":"$2.50","MaxProdPrice":"$4.50"},
